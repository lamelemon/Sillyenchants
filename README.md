# Sillyenchants
Adds some enchants to papermc

## Important note:

The first time you run your server with this plugin installed will cause the server to either shut down or restart.
This is normal as it is generating the configuration file for the enchantments. 
If your server shuts down without restarting, you should be able to start up the server again.

See [Guide](https://gist.github.com/Prof-Bloodstone/6367eb4016eaf9d1646a88772cdbbac5) if you'd like to make your server restart instead of having it shut down all the way.
